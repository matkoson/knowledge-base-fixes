## Fixed PR #1 GitHub Actions Workflow Issues

### Summary

This update resolves all issues related to the failing GitHub Actions workflow in PR #1 (Linear issue [MAT-145](https://linear.app/matkoson-master/issue/MAT-145/fix-failing-github-actions-workflow-in-pr-1)). The changes implement robust solutions for SQLite compatibility across different environments, TypeScript typing, Git hooks configuration, and CI/CD workflows.

### Key Changes

1. **SQLite Cross-Environment Compatibility**
   - Created a robust `sqlite_adapter.ts` that conditionally imports SQLite implementations based on the runtime environment
   - Replaced direct `bun:sqlite` imports with the adapter throughout the codebase
   - Added comprehensive error handling for database operations

2. **TypeScript Type Improvements**
   - Added proper type definitions for external dependencies (turndown.d.ts)
   - Replaced generic `any` types with specific interfaces
   - Improved type safety throughout the codebase

3. **Git Hooks Configuration**
   - Fixed pre-commit and pre-push hooks in lefthook.yml
   - Ensured hooks properly handle file-specific linting
   - Added skip configurations for merge and rebase operations

4. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Created a comprehensive CI workflow with separate jobs for lint, typecheck, test, and build
   - Added environment-specific setup for tests
   - Implemented artifact archiving for build outputs

5. **Database Testing and Validation**
   - Added test suite for database operations
   - Created database setup and validation utilities
   - Implemented cross-environment test compatibility

6. **Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions
   - Created a detailed developer guide with best practices
   - Documented common issues and solutions
